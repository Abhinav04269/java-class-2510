Programming paradigms refer to the styles and approaches for designing and structuring computer programs. 

Imperative Paradigm

Key Concept: Explicitly define the steps needed to achieve the desired outcome.


Languages: Java, Python, C (when using loops and variables) etc
Declarative Paradigm
The declarative paradigm focuses on what to do, rather than how to do it.  The programmer specifies the desired result, and the language or system takes care of how to get there.

Key Concept: Focus on the what rather than the how.


Languages: SQL, HTML, CSS etc
